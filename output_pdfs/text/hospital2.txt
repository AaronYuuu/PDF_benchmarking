Variant 1 of 2
Gene STIL
Variant c.394G>C
Amino Zygosity p.Glu132CIn homozygous Variant of uncertain clinical significance 6 The g.472505326>C variant occurs in chromosome chr] within the STIL gene , and it causes â‚¬,394G>C change at position 132 in exon 18 causing the mu- tation p.Glu132Gln This mutation has been identified in 33 families, It has a population frequency of 0.00e+00 (0 alleles in 527781 total alleles tested) , indi- cating it is a very rare variant in the general population It causes an amino acid substitution, which replaces glutamate with glutamine ClinVar and other ge- nomic databases report the STIL c.3946>C variant as clinically relevant based on aggregated evidence. The clinical implications of this variant are not yet fully understood: At present , available data is insufficient to confirm its role in disease_ The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across ver- tebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary con- straint, This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV003580448). Supporting studies and case reports can be found in the scientific literature. Rel- evant PubMed references include: 852145429, 926084914,206744673,803069417, 811657780

Variant 2 of 2
Gene GATA3
Variant c.1331G>A
Amino
Zygosity heterozygous
p.GlyAA4Asp
Variant of uncertain clinical significance
The g.8046708G>A variant occurs in chromosome chrI0 within the GATA3 gene , andit causes c.1331G>Achange atposition 444in exon 8 , causing the mutation p.GlyA44Asp This mutation has been identified in 40 families. It has a popula- tion frequency of 1.13e-05 (6 alleles in 532228 total alleles tested) , indicating it is a very rare variant in the general population: It causes an amino acid sub- stitution, which replaces glycine with aspartate ClinVar and other genomic databases report the GATA3 c.1331G>A variant as clinically relevant based on aggregated evidence. The clinical implications of this variant are not yet fully understood: At present , available data is insufficient to confirm its role in disease. The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across ver- tebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary con- straint, This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV003655358) , Supporting studies and case reports can be found in the scientific literature.

Recommendations A precision oncology approach is advised: These mutations are known onco- genic drivers, linked to constitutive pathway activation. Targeted therapies, including hormone-correcting agents, may be considered, guided by clinical judgment; PI3K inhibitors could be explored in trials for PIK3CA-mutated cases. Germline testing is not indicated, as all mutations are consistent with somatic events, A multidisciplinary tumour board review is recommended to integrate findings into care: Additional testing may be pursued at the physician's discre- tion;
Methodology Total RNA was sequenced with Whole exome sequencing (WES) and was ana- lyzed using Variant analysis covering all coding exons and adjacent intronic re- gions. Target enrichment was performed with hybrid capture (Twist Bioscience) ; followed by Illumina NextSeq sequencing: Reads were aligned to GRCh37 US - ing BWA-MEM, and variants called with GATK, Annotation waS performed in VarSeq using population databases, predictive algorithms, and ClinVar: CNVs were assessed with CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA when applicable; Regions with pseudogene interference , such as PMS2 , were validated using long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing; Mean read depth exceeded 30Ox , with a mini- mum threshold of 5Ox. Analytical sensitivity is > 99% for SNVs/indels and >95* for exon-level CNVs. Only variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are reported, per ACMGIAMP guide- lines (PMID: 25741868). Limitations This test was developed and validated in a certified clinical laboratory: Limi- tations include reduced sensitivity in pseudogene regions (e.g., PMS2 , CHEK2), and inability to detect certain structuralvariants (e.g., MSH2 inversions) , deep in- tronic changes, or Iow-level mosaicism, PMS2 exons 1-15 are not analyzed: In- terpretations reflect current knowledge and may be updated as new evidence
