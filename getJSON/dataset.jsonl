It has a population frequency of 5.08e-04 (241 alleles in 474545 total alleles tested), in- dicating it is a relatively common variant in the general population, It causes an amino acid substitution, which replaces aspartate with valine ClinVar and other genomic databases report the AKAPQ €.9713A>T variant as clinically rel- evant based on aggregated evidence. The clinical implications of this variant are not yet fully understood. At present , available data is insufficient to confirm its role in disease_ The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across ver- tebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary con- straint, This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV002233128).

These mutations are known onco- genic drivers, Iinked to constitutive pathway activation: Targeted therapies, including hormone-correcting agents, may be considered, guided by clinical judgment, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in trials for PIK3CA-mutated cases; Germline testing is not indicated, as all mutations are consistent with somatic events, A multidisciplinary tumour board review is recommended to integrate findings into care. Additional testing may be pursued at the physician's discre- tion:\nMethodology CtDNA waS sequenced with Gene panel and was analyzed using Repeat ex- pansion analysis covering all coding exons and adjacent intronic regions. Target enrichment was performed with hybrid capture (Twist Bioscience) , followed by Illumina NextSeq sequencing: Reads were aligned to GRCh37 using BWA-MEM, and variants called with GATK. Annotation was performed in VarSeq using pop ulation databases, predictive algorithms, and ClinVar: CNVs were assessed with CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA when applicable; Regions with pseudogene in- terference, such as PMSZ , were validated using long-range PCR and Sanger se- quencing: Mean read depth exceeded 30Ox , with a minimum threshold of 5Ox. Analytical sensitivity is >99% for SNVs /indels and >95% for exon-level CNVs, Only variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain sig- nificance (VUS) are reported, per ACMGIAMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868). Limitations This test was developed and validated in a certified clinical laboratory: Limi- tations include reduced sensitivity in pseudogene regions (e.g., PMS2 , CHEK2) , andinability to detect certain structural variants (e.g., MSHZ inversions) , deepin- tronic changes, or low-level mosaicism. PMS2 exons 11-15 are not analyzed.

The clinical relevance of this variant remains unclear; Currently, there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute its role in disease_ The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary constraint: This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV002233128).

Specifically, pharma- ceutical treatment is also recommended to correct hormone imbalances that may be caused by these mutations. However, the clinician's advice takes precedence. Addi- tionally, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in clinical trials for the PIK3CA-mutated context, Further germline testing is not indicated at this time, as all three mutations are consistent with somatic oncogenic events. Multidisciplinary tumour board review is advised to inte grate molecular findings into the patient's treatment plan. Further genetic testing may be required and completed at a physician's discretion. Methodology Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed using a custom-designed targeted sequenc- ing panel encompassing all coding exons and at least 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for the specified genes   Target enrichment waS performed using hybrid capture technology (Twist Bioscience), followed by paired-endsequencing on the Illumina NextSeq platform: Sequencing reads were aligned to the GRCh37 /hg19 human genome reference using BWA-MEM, and variant calling was performed using GATK (Broad Institute).

Regions with known pseudogeneinterference, such as PMS2 , were validated with long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing  The average read depth across all targeted regions exceeded 30Ox, with a minimum depth threshold of 50x. The analytical sensitivity for single nucleotide variants and small indels is >99%, and for exon-level CNVs, >95%, Only variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are reported, according to ACMGIAMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868). Limitations This test was developed and validated by a certified clinical laboratory: Limitations include reduced sensitivity in regions with pseudogenes (e.g _ PMS2 , CHEK2) , and inability to de- tect certain structural variants (e.g., MSH2 inversion), deep intronic changes, or low-level mosaicism; PMS2 exons 11-15 are not assessed due to pseudogene interference.
