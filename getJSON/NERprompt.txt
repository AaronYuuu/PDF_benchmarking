Variant 1 of 1
Gene AKAPQ
Variant C.9713A>T
Amino
Zygosity homozygous
p.Asp3238Val
Variant of uncertain clinical significance
The 9.916 950552A>Tvariant occurs in chromosome chr7 within the AKAPO gene , and it causes C.9713A>T change at position 3238 in exon 8 causing the muta- tion p.Asp3238Val This mutation has been identified in 40 families. It has a population frequency of 5.08e-04 (241 alleles in 474545 total alleles tested), in- dicating it is a relatively common variant in the general population, It causes an amino acid substitution, which replaces aspartate with valine ClinVar and other genomic databases report the AKAPQ â‚¬.9713A>T variant as clinically rel- evant based on aggregated evidence. The clinical implications of this variant are not yet fully understood. At present , available data is insufficient to confirm its role in disease_ The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across ver- tebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary con- straint, This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV002233128). Supporting studies and case reports can be found in the scientific literature, Relevant PubMed references include: 774292710, 554428923,264019035

Toronto Cancer Hospital Division of Tumor info@och,on.ca Sequencing and fax: 416-456-7890 Diagnostics phone: 437-416-6470 According to ClinVar; the evidence collected to date is insufficient to firmly es- tablish the clinical significance of this variant, therefore it is classified as a variant of uncertain clinical significance Test Details:
Genes Analyzed and mRNA sequence (NM_): CBFA2T3 and NM_005187.6, ALDH2 and NM_000690.4, MYB and NM_001 130173.2. ACVRIB and NM_004302.5. CTCF and NM_006565.4. AKAPQ and NM_005751,5, ATFTIP and NM_018179.5. DDIT3 and NM_004083.6. 8 total genes tested 
Recommendations A precision oncology approach Is advised. These mutations are known onco- genic drivers, Iinked to constitutive pathway activation: Targeted therapies, including hormone-correcting agents, may be considered, guided by clinical judgment, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in trials for PIK3CA-mutated cases; Germline testing is not indicated, as all mutations are consistent with somatic events, A multidisciplinary tumour board review is recommended to integrate findings into care. Additional testing may be pursued at the physician's discre- tion:
Methodology CtDNA waS sequenced with Gene panel and was analyzed using Repeat ex- pansion analysis covering all coding exons and adjacent intronic regions. Target enrichment was performed with hybrid capture (Twist Bioscience) , followed by Illumina NextSeq sequencing: Reads were aligned to GRCh37 using BWA-MEM, and variants called with GATK. Annotation was performed in VarSeq using pop ulation databases, predictive algorithms, and ClinVar: CNVs were assessed with CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA when applicable; Regions with pseudogene in- terference, such as PMSZ , were validated using long-range PCR and Sanger se- quencing: Mean read depth exceeded 30Ox , with a minimum threshold of 5Ox. Analytical sensitivity is >99% for SNVs /indels and >95% for exon-level CNVs, Only variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain sig- nificance (VUS) are reported, per ACMGIAMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868). Limitations This test was developed and validated in a certified clinical laboratory: Limi- tations include reduced sensitivity in pseudogene regions (e.g., PMS2 , CHEK2) , andinability to detect certain structural variants (e.g., MSHZ inversions) , deepin- tronic changes, or low-level mosaicism. PMS2 exons 11-15 are not analyzed. In- terpretations reflect current knowledge and may be updated as new evidence emerges;
