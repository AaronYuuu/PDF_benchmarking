This variant is considered Iikely pathogenic: It has been associated with deleterious effects on protein function and may contribute to disease in affected individuals.

Targeted therapies should be evaluated based on these molecular findings. Specifically, pharma- ceutical treatment is also recommended to correct hormone imbalances that may be caused by these mutations; However, the clinician's advice takes precedence. Addi- tionally, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in clinical trials for the PIK3CA-mutated context. Further germline testing is not indicated at this time, as all three mutations are consistent with somatic oncogenic events. Multidisciplinary tumour board review is advised to inte grate molecular findings into the patient's treatment plan: Further genetic testing may be required and completed at a physician's discretion: Methodology Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed using a custom-designed targeted sequenc- ing panel encompassing all coding exons and at least 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for the specified genes.  Target enrichment waS performed using hybrid capture technology (Twist Bioscience)  followed by paired-endsequencing on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to the GRCh37 /hg19 human genome reference using BWA-MEM, and variant calling was performed using GATK (Broad Institute): Annota- tion and interpretation of variants were conducted using VarSeq (Golden Helix) , incorpo- rating population frequency databases, in silico prediction tools, and ClinVar Exon-level copy number variations were evaluated using CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA (MRC Hol-\nOntario Cancer Hospital\nNote that this is @ draft dataset\nPage 2\n\nOCH\nMRN:\nDate Collected: 2024-06-16\nNote this is @ draft dataset\nland) when applicable.

Variant 1 of 1 C2orf44 c.516G>A p.Vall72= ) The c.516G>A variant occurs at position 172 and is located in exon 16 of the C2orf44 gene, within chromosome chr2 It causes no amino acid change. ClinVar and other genomic databases report the C2orf44 c.516G>A variant as clinically relevant based on aggregated evidence. This variant is considered likely pathogenic: It has been associated with deleterious effects on protein function and may contribute to disease in affected individuals. The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary constraint; This variant is implicated in oncogenesis and other disease processes according to Clin- Var records (VCV accession: VCVOO1037284). Supporting studies and case reports can be found in the scientific literature, Relevant PubMed references include: 735412060,784926767, 762931569 In accordance with existing evidence , this variant is therefore classified as & likely pathogenic variant;\nRecommendations We recommend a precision oncology approach: These variants are associated with con- stitutive pathway activation and are well-established drivers of tumourigenesis.  Targeted therapies should be evaluated based on these molecular findings. Specifically, pharma- ceutical treatment is also recommended to correct hormone imbalances that may be caused by these mutations; However, the clinician's advice takes precedence. Addi- tionally, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in clinical trials for the PIK3CA-mutated context. Further germline testing is not indicated at this time, as all three mutations are consistent with somatic oncogenic events. Multidisciplinary tumour board review is advised to inte grate molecular findings into the patient's treatment plan: Further genetic testing may be required and completed at a physician's discretion: Methodology Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed using a custom-designed targeted sequenc- ing panel encompassing all coding exons and at least 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for the specified genes.  Target enrichment waS performed using hybrid capture technology (Twist Bioscience)  followed by paired-endsequencing on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to the GRCh37 /hg19 human genome reference using BWA-MEM, and variant calling was performed using GATK (Broad Institute): Annota- tion and interpretation of variants were conducted using VarSeq (Golden Helix) , incorpo- rating population frequency databases, in silico prediction tools, and ClinVar Exon-level copy number variations were evaluated using CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA (MRC Hol-\nOntario Cancer Hospital\nNote that this is @ draft dataset\nPage 2\n\nOCH\nMRN:\nDate Collected: 2020-05-02\nNote this is @ draft dataset\nland) when applicable.

Annota- tion and interpretation of variants were conducted using VarSeq (Golden Helix) , incorpo- rating population frequency databases, in silico prediction tools, and ClinVar; Exon-level copy number variations were evaluated using CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA (MRC Hol- land) when applicable. Regions with known pseudogeneinterference, such as PMS2 ,_ were validated with long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing: The average read depth across all targeted regions exceeded 30Ox, with a minimum depth threshold of 5Ox, The analytical sensitivity for single nucleotide variants and small indels is >99%, and for exon-level CNVs, >95%. Only variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are reported, according to ACMG/AMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868). Limitations This test was developed and validated by a certified clinical laboratory. Limitations include reduced sensitivity in regions with pseudogenes (e.g., PMSZ , CHEK2) , and inability to de- tect certain structural variants (e.g. MSH2 inversion) , deep intronic changes, or low-level mosaicism; PMS2 exons 11-15 are not assessed due to pseudogene interference.

Variant 1 of 2 RPS15 C.376G7C p.Vall26Leu ) The €.3766>C variant occurs at position 126 and is located in exon of the RPS15 gene, within chromosome chr19 It causes an amino acid substitution, which replaces valine with leucine ClinVar and other genomic databases report the RPST5 c.3766>C variant aS clinically relevant based on aggregated evidence. This variant is considered Iikely pathogenic: It has been associated with deleterious effects on protein function and may contribute to disease in affected individuals. The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary constraint; This variant is implicated in oncogenesis and other disease processes according to Clin- Var records (VCV accession: VCVO01282991).

Relevant PubMed references include: 416561588, 585889599 , 797850034, 605887806, 653024184 In accordance with existing evidence, this variant is therefore classified as a likely pathogenic variant; Variant 2 of 2 RPS15 c.75G>Tp.Leu25= ) The c.75G>T variant occurs at position 25 and is located in exon 1 of the RPSI5 gene, within chromosome chr19 It causes no amino acid change. ClinVar and other genomic databases report the RPSI5 c.75G>T variant as clinically relevant based on aggregated evidence, The clinical relevance of this variant remains unclear; Currently, there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute its role in disease. The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary constraint; This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV000646780).

ClinVar and other genomic databases report the TNKZ €.2082G>C variant as clinically relevant based on aggregated evidence, This variant is considered likely pathogenic: It has been associated with deleterious effects on protein function and may contribute to disease in affected individuals. The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary constraint; This variant is implicated in oncogenesis and other disease processes according to Clin- Var records (VCV accession: VCVOO1482074). Supporting studies and case reports can be found in the scientific literature. Relevant PubMed references include: 661870669, 924455047, 682417977,699513409 In accordance with existing evidence , this variant is therefore clas sified as a likely pathogenic variant;\nRecommendations We recommend a precision oncology approach: These variants are associated with con- stitutive pathway activation and are well-established drivers of tumourigenesis.  Targeted therapies should be evaluated based on these molecular findings. Specifically, pharma- ceutical treatment is also recommended to correct hormone imbalances that may be caused by these mutations; However, the clinician's advice takes precedence. Addi- tionally, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in clinical trials for the PIK3CA-mutated context. Further germline testing is not indicated at this time, as all three mutations are consistent with somatic oncogenic events. Multidisciplinary tumour board review is advised to inte grate molecular findings into the patient's treatment plan: Further genetic testing may be required and completed at a physician's discretion: Methodology Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed using a custom-designed targeted sequenc- ing panel encompassing all coding exons and at least 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for the specified genes.  Target enrichment waS performed using hybrid capture technology (Twist Bioscience)  followed by paired-endsequencing on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to the GRCh37 /hg19 human genome reference using BWA-MEM, and variant calling was performed using GATK (Broad Institute): Annota- tion and interpretation of variants were conducted using VarSeq (Golden Helix) , incorpo- rating population frequency databases, in silico prediction tools, and ClinVar Exon-level copy number variations were evaluated using CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA (MRC Hol-\nOntario Cancer Hospital\nNote that this is @ draft dataset\nPage 2\n\nOCH\nMRN:\nDate Collected: 2020-04-26\nNote this is @ draft dataset\nland) when applicable. Regions with known pseudogeneinterference, such as PMS2 , were validated with long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing: The average read depth across all targeted regions exceeded 30Ox , with a minimum depth threshold of 5Ox.

Targeted therapies should be evaluated based on these molecular findings. Specifically, pharma- ceutical treatment is also recommended to correct hormone imbalances that may be caused by these mutations; However, the clinician's advice takes precedence. Addi- tionally, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in clinical trials for the PIK3CA-mutated context. Further germline testing is not indicated at this time, as all three mutations are consistent with somatic oncogenic events. Multidisciplinary tumour board review is advised to inte grate molecular findings into the patient's treatment plan: Further genetic testing may be required and completed at a physician's discretion: Methodology Genomic DNA waS extracted and analyzed using a custom-designed targeted sequenc- ing panel encompassing all coding exons and at least 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for the specified genes.

The clinical relevance of this variant remains unclear; Currently, there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute its role in disease _ The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary constraint; This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV006327377). Supporting studies and case reports can be found in the scientific literature. Relevant PubMed references include: 702745864,839379021, 100052864, 273504546 According to ClinVar; the evidence collected to date is insufficient to firmly establish the clinical significance of this variant, therefore it is classified as a variant of uncertain clinical significance\nRecommendations We recommend a precision oncology approach: These variants are associated with con- stitutive pathway activation and are well-established drivers of tumourigenesis  Targeted therapies should be evaluated based on these molecular findings. Specifically, pharma- ceutical treatment is also recommended to correct hormone imbalances that may be caused by these mutations; However, the clinician's advice takes precedence. Addi- tionally, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in clinical trials for the PIK3CA-mutated context; Further germline testing is not indicated at this time, as all three mutations are consistent\nOntario Cancer Hospital\nNote that this is @ draft dataset\nPage 4\n\nOCH\nMRN:\nDate Collected: 2022-05-06\nNote this is @ draft dataset\nwith somatic oncogenic events. Multidisciplinary tumour board review is advised to inte grate molecular findings into the patient's treatment plan: Further genetic testing may be required and completed at a physician's discretion, Methodology Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed using a custom-designed targeted sequenc- ing panel encompassing all coding exons and at least 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for the specified genes   Target enrichment waS performed using hybrid capture technology (Twist Bioscience)  followed by paired-endsequencing on the Illumina NextSeq platform: Sequencing reads were aligned to NCBI Build 34 human genome reference us- ing BWA-MEM, and variant calling was performed using GATK (Broad Institute). Annotation and interpretation of variants were conducted using VarSeq (Golden Helix) , incorporating population frequency databases, in silico prediction tools, and ClinVar; Exon-level copy number variations were evaluated using CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA (MRC Holland) when applicable. Regions with known pseudogene interference , such as PMS2 , were val- idated with long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing: The average read depth across all targeted regions exceeded 30Ox, with a minimum depth threshold of 5Ox. The analytical sensitivity for single nucleotide variants and small indels is >99%, and for exon-level CNVs, >95%, Only variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are reported, according to ACMG/AMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868). Limitations This test was developed and validated by a certified clinical laboratory: Limitations include reduced sensitivity in regions with pseudogenes (e.g:, PMS2 , CHEK2), and inability to de- tect certain structural variants (e.g._ MSH2 inversion) , deep intronic changes, or low-level mosaicism, PMS2 exons 11-15 are not assessed due to pseudogene interference. Variant interpretation reflects current scientific knowledge and may evolve over time.\nOntario Cancer Hospital\nNote that this is @ draft dataset\nPage 5\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " {\n  \"date_collected\": \"2022-05-06\",\n  \"date_received\": \"2022-05-07\",\n  \"date_verified\": \"2022-05-08\",\n  \"report_type\": \"\",\n  \"testing_context\": \"Research\",\n  \"ordering_clinic\": \"\",\n  \"testing_laboratory\": \"\",\n  \"sequencing_scope\": \"\",\n  \"tested_genes\": {\n    \"DEPDC5\": {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"DEPDC5\",\n      \"refseq_mrna\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"CDX2\": {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"CDX2\",\n      \"refseq_mrna\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"NCOR1\": {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"NCOR1\",\n      \"refseq_mrna\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"SYNE1\": {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"SYNE1\",\n      \"refseq_mrna\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"HIST1H4F\": {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"HIST1H4F\",\n      \"refseq_mrna\": \"\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"num_tested_genes\": \"5\",\n  \"sample_type\": \"Total RNA\",\n  \"analysis_type\": \"Microarray\",\n  \"variants\": [\n    {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"NCOR1\",\n      \"variant_id\": \"VCV007426111\",\n      \"chromosome\": \"chr17\",\n      \"hgvsg\": \"\",\n      \"hgvsc\": \"c.2650A>T\",\n      \"hgvsp\": \"p.Ser884Cys\",\n      \"transcript_id\": \"NM_006311.4\",\n      \"exon\": \"34\",\n      \"zygosity\": \"heterozygous\",\n      \"interpretation\": \"Variant of uncertain clinical significance\",\n      \"mafac\": \"\",\n      \"mafan\": \"\",\n      \"mafaf\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"CDX2\",\n      \"variant_id\": \"VCV002990799\",\n      \"chromosome\": \"chr13\",\n      \"hgvsg\": \"\",\n      \"hgvsc\": \"c.629A>C\",\n      \"hgvsp\": \"p.Tyr210Ser\",\n      \"transcript_id\": \"NM_001265.6\",\n      \"exon\": \"3\",\n      \"zygosity\": \"heterozygous\",\n      \"interpretation\": \"Likely pathogenic\",\n      \"mafac\": \"\",\n      \"mafan\": \"\",\n      \"mafaf\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"NCOR1\",\n      \"variant_id\": \"VCV000840536\",\n      \"chromosome\": \"chr17\",\n      \"hgvsg\": \"\",\n      \"hgvsc\": \"c.941T>A\",\n      \"hgvsp\": \"p.Leu314His\",\n      \"transcript_id\": \"NM_006311.4\",\n      \"exon\": \"34\",\n      \"zygosity\": \"homozygous\",\n      \"interpretation\": \"Likely pathogenic\",\n      \"mafac\": \"\",\n      \"mafan\": \"\",\n      \"mafaf\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"HIST1H4F\",\n      \"variant_id\": \"VCV008214897\",\n      \"chromosome\": \"chr6\",\n      \"hgvsg\": \"\",\n      \"hgvsc\": \"c.5C>G\",\n      \"hgvsp\": \"p.Ser2Cys\",\n      \"transcript_id\": \"NM_003540.3\",\n      \"exon\": \"5\",\n      \"zygosity\": \"heterozygous\",\n      \"interpretation\": \"Likely pathogenic\",\n      \"mafac\": \"\",\n      \"mafan\": \"\",\n      \"mafaf\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"gene_symbol\": \"NCOR1\",\n      \"variant_id\": \"VCV006327377\",\n      \"chromosome\": \"chr17\",\n      \"hgvsg\": \"\",\n      \"hgvsc\": \"c.942C>T\",\n      \"hgvsp\": \"p.Leu314=\",\n      \"transcript_id\": \"NM_006311.4\",\n      \"exon\": \"34\",\n      \"zygosity\": \"heterozygous\",\n      \"interpretation\": \"Variant of uncertain clinical significance\",\n      \"mafac\": \"\",\n      \"mafan\": \"\",\n      \"mafaf\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_variants\": \"5\",\n  \"reference_genome\": \"\"\n}\n\nEND\n\n"}

Variant 1 of 1 WTI c.1172G>A p.Ser39]Asn ) The c.1172G>A variant occurs at position 391 and is located in exon 10 of the WTI gene, within chromosome chr] 1 It causes an amino acid substitution, which replaces serine with asparagine ClinVar and other genomic databases report the WTI c,1172G>A variant as clinically relevant based on aggregated evidence. The clinical relevance of this variant remains unclear; Currently, there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute its role in disease_ The affected nucleotide lies within a region that is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which suggests functional importance and evolutionary constraint: This variant is not currently strongly implicated in specific diseases according to ClinVar records (VCV accession: VCV003541430). Supporting studies and case reports can be found in the scientific literature. Relevant PubMed references include: 312339998, 384960560, 996935442 According to ClinVar; the evidence collected to date is insufficient to firmly establish the clinical significance of this variant, therefore it is classified as a variant of un- certain clinical significance\nRecommendations We recommend a precision oncology approach; These variants are associated with con- stitutive pathway activation and are well-established drivers of tumourigenesis   Targeted therapies should be evaluated based on these molecular findings. Specifically, pharma- ceutical treatment is also recommended to correct hormone imbalances that may be caused by these mutations. However, the clinician's advice takes precedence. Addi- tionally, PI3K inhibitors could be explored in clinical trials for the PIK3CA-mutated context, Further germline testing is not indicated at this time, as all three mutations are consistent with somatic oncogenic events. Multidisciplinary tumour board review is advised to inte grate molecular findings into the patient's treatment plan. Further genetic testing may be required and completed at a physician's discretion. Methodology Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed using a custom-designed targeted sequenc- ing panel encompassing all coding exons and at least 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for the specified genes   Target enrichment waS performed using hybrid capture technology (Twist Bioscience), followed by paired-endsequencing on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to GRCh37 human genome reference using BWA-MEM, and variant calling was performed using GATK (Broad Institute): Annotation and interpretation of variants were conducted using VarSeq (Golden Helix), incorporating population frequency databases, in silico prediction tools, and ClinVar; Exon-level copy\nOntario Cancer Hospital\nNote that this is @ draft dataset\nPage 3\n\nOCH\nMRN:\nDate Collected: 2022-07-28\nNote this is @ draft dataset\nnumber variations were evaluated using CNVkit and confirmed by MLPA (MRC Holland) when applicable. Regions with known pseudogene interference , such as PMS2 , were val- idated with long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing: The average read depth across all targeted regions exceeded 30Ox, with a minimum depth threshold of 5Ox. The analytical sensitivity for single nucleotide variants and small indels is >99%, and for exon-level CNVs, >95%, Only variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are reported, according to ACMGIAMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868).
